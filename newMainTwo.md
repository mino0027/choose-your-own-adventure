# A Dream?
### Chapter One: ...

You wake up...

<sup>*you try to go back to sleep*</sup>

You cannot close your eyes, you feel like you are both tired yet wide awake. You also realize you cannot blink. You find this strange.

You begin to shout out *"Hello, is anyone there?"*, but you realize there is no sound, no vibration from your voice, you are just mouthing the words.

## Panic sets in.
